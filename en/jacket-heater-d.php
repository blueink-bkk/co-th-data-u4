                     <p> ULTIMHEAT Technology Flat Heaters : 9VJF-Carboy and bucket jacket heater, The professional solution</p>
                     <h1 class="main-title">Carboy and bucket jacket heater
The professional solution</h1>
                     <h5>Main Applications</h5>
                     <p>These insulated jacket heaters are specially designed to assist with fermentation of must or wort in home brewing of beer and wine. They are for use on 5 and 6 gallon (18L and 23L) brew buckets, fermenters and carboys. They distribute 140 watts of heat gently over their full area of 3.5 square feet, providing less than 0.3W/in² (0.05W/cm²) of heating density, keeping the contents at a constant 73-74°F (22-23°C). They can be used on glass carboys in good condition (no cracks) and on plastic buckets. The surface temperature is controlled by high precision thermostat.</p>



                     <h5>Main Feature</h5>
                     <p><b>Power:</b> 140W, 110/120V or 230/240V. This power level, added to the efficient thermal insulation, is sufficient to raise and stabilize the carboy temperature at 70-74°F (21-22°C) in ambient temperatures as low as 32°F (0°C).</p>
                     <p><b>Size versions:</b>
                     - 5 US gallons (OD=10.5in +/-0.5in or 267 mm +/-12 mm): flat size 1ft x 3.1ft (300 x 950 mm), scarf not included,<br>
                     - 6 US gallons (OD= 11.5in +/-0.5in or 295 mm +/-12 mm) : flat size 1ft x 3.5ft (300 x 1050 mm), scarf not included.<br>
                     The same blanket will fit the glass carboy and/or the plastic bucket for a given size. For example, the 5 gallon blanket will fit the 5 gallon carboy or the 5 gallon plastic bucket. The heating blanket has a small unheated area on both edges to allow for a bucket with a tapered. This allows for a small overlap at the bottom without overheating.</p>
                     
                     <p><b>Warning:</b> 6US gallon= 5UK gallon</p>
                     
                     <p><b>Thermostat:</b> Fixed setting, calibrated at 72°F+/-5°F (22°C +/-3°C)</p>
                     
                     <p><b>Washing and cleaning:</b> DISCONNECT FROM THE POWER SUPPLY! The jacket can be cleaned with a wet sponge and soap; gently rinsed with a sponge and clean water; and dried, but never immersed in any liquid. Not suitable for machine washing.</p>
                     
                     <p><b>Power cord:</b> length 6 ft (2 m)</p>
                     
                     <p><b>Safety:</b> Since glass or plastic containers may break or leak and leave an energized blanket lying in a pool of liquid, the blankets are supplied with a 6 mA, class A, 2 prong GFCI plug (US version) or 3 prong PRCD (portable residual current device, for European version)</p>
                     
                     <p><b>Insulation:</b> 0.8" (10 mm) NPR-PVC rubber foam on the heated surface</p>
                     
                     <p><b>Light and UV protection scarf:</b> The "scarf" is permanently attached to the top edge of the blanket and can be raised and tightened around the neck of the bottle or bucket with the draw string. If not used, it can be folded down along the outside of the heater.</p>
                     
                     <p><b>Mounting:</b> held on with 2" wide (50 mm) nylon strap lined with hook and loop fabric on the full circumference.
                     </p>
                     
                     <p><b>Water drip protection:</b> is provided by using a waterproof PU coated high strength nylon Fabric. Additionally, all internal wiring is water drip protected.</p>
                     
                     <p><b>Electrical insulation (dry):</b> > 15Gohms. Laboratory testing shows that a new product, handled and used properly still has an electrical insulation performance higher than 10Gohms when wetted by carboy breakage (If the insulation is not cut by the glass).<br> NB : 1 Gohm= 1000Mohms</p>

                     <p><b>High pot insulation:</b> > 2500V, 2mA, 1min</p>
                    
                     <p><b>Cord retainer:</b> a riveted stainless steel retainer provides a high resistance to cord pull out</p>
                     
                     <p><b>Overheat protection:</b> If used on an empty container (plastic or glass), the surface temperature that the heater could reach 105°F (40 °C)</p>

                     <p>In normal use but worst conditions is could be 85°F (30 °C)</p>

                    <p> Plastics most commonly used for buckets are:
                    - food grade PP (polypropylene), with a maximum temperature of 275°F (135°C)<br>
                    - food grade HDPE (high density polyethylene), with a maximum temperature of 248°F (120°C)<br>
                    Plastic most commonly used for carboys is:<br>
                   Food grade PET with a maximum temperature of 140°F (60°C). We do not recommend the use our jacket heaters on PET carboys, as the safety margins is very small<br>
                   between maximum surface temperature that the heater can reach and the maximum temperature that can be withstood by the PET .<br>
                   This data about plastic temperature ratings are informational only, and may differ from one supplier to another.<br>
