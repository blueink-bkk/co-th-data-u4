<meta name="description" content="Blue Ink Bangkok Thailand - ULTIMHEAT Technology : Control and Safety Devices, Creep action fixed setting strip thermostat. These medium rating snap action thermostats are flat in construction, approx. 24 x 10 x 4 mm. They are made with conductive bimetal construction: the bimetallic element carries the circuit current. The creep action provides slow make/slow break switching action. There is no built-in differential between the opening and closing temperature. This creep action can cause radio frequency interference. In enclosures that have sensitive electronics, they must be covered by a boot that is bonded to the heater">

					 <h3>Remote electronic temperature control</h3>
					 
					 <h5>Main Features:</h5>
					 
                     <p>1. Standard electronic temperature control can be set in °C or °F, resolution 0.1° (for display of less than 100), on off action. Temperature set range -45 to + 120°C (-49 °F to 248 °F). Other temperature range up to 200°C (xx°F) on request. Protected against malicious set point modification.<br/>
					 
					2. Standard rating 16A 230V, or 20A 230V, 30A 115V with built in power relay version<br/>
					
					3. Exclusive: One electronic control can be used to control 2 flexible belts located on the same drum.<br/>
					
					4. 2 temperature sensing versions: -Built in sensor inside the belt -Remote sensor (No sensor inside the belt), for temperature sensing inside the drum. This sensor must always remain immersed inside the liquid.<br/>
					
					5. Belt surface temperature protector is included if remote sensor<br/>
					
					6. IP65, IK10, wall mounting control housing<br/>
					
					7. 220/230V and 110/115V models<br/>
