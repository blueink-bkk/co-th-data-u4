              <h5>Applications</h5>
              <p>The sealing of the free end of the heating cables, in particular constant power cables or self-regulating cables is simplified by these boots, which eliminates the use of RTV resins on field, which needs difficult cleaning along with long lifetime residue pollutants, or heat-shrinkable sleeves, which require a heating equipment and which perfect seal is not always guaranteed.<br>
              These sleeves should simply be pushed on the cable ends. Then the silicone gel covers the entire cable and conductors located therein.</p>
              <h5>Main features</h5>
               <p><b>Boot material: </b>UL 94-VO, black silicone (other colors on request). Temperature resistance 220 ° C.<br>
 <p><b>Filling material: </b>silicone gel filling 50% of the internal volume of the boot. Insulation resistance 1.1×1015 Ω·cm @500V.<br>
Temperature resistance -60 + 260°C.<br>
Needle penetration (1/10mm): 70</p>
               <p><b>Boot dimensions:</b> The elasticity of the silicone, higher than 200%, allows it to fit the exact shape of the cable. We recommend selecting a cap that is 10 to 20% smaller than the cable section. (Manufacture of special dimensions possible, MOQ 1000 pieces)</p>
              <p><b>NB:</b> As new references are added regularly, ask for an updated list if you intend to use these products.<br>
             Many other models of silicone boots for heat tracing can be found in our catalog No. 3</p>
