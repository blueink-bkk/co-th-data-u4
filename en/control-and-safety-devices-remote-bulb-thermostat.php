<meta name="description" content="Blue Ink Bangkok Thailand - ULTIMHEAT Technology : Control and Safety Devices, Creep action fixed setting strip thermostat. These medium rating snap action thermostats are flat in construction, approx. 24 x 10 x 4 mm. They are made with conductive bimetal construction: the bimetallic element carries the circuit current. The creep action provides slow make/slow break switching action. There is no built-in differential between the opening and closing temperature. This creep action can cause radio frequency interference. In enclosures that have sensitive electronics, they must be covered by a boot that is bonded to the heater">
