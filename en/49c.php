              <h5>Applications</h5>
               <p>Overmolding a disc thermostat on a heating cable allows to switch it on when the room temperature falls below a certain threshold, and to switch it off when the temperature rises.<br>
                Overmolding improves the mechanical strength of the assembly and provides a good ingress protection to water.<br>
                Thanks to the special process developed in our laboratories, Polyamide 66 injection molding does not overheat the disc of the thermostat, avoiding in this way the set point temperature drift that this operation usually brings.</p>



              <h5>Main features</h5>
                <p><b>Thermostat housing:</b> : Black PA66, 21x16x 30mm, IP65. Good UV resistance. Excellent cable pull strength at both ends (total length 100mm)</p>
<p><b>Part sensitive to temperature:</b> Stainless steel cup, not over molded to improve temperature measurement</p>
<p><b>Contact:</b> Open by temperature rise.</p>
<p><b>Electrical rating:</b><br>
-16A Resistive, 250V, 100,000 cycles, with differential 6 ° C.<br>
- 8A resistive, 250V, 100,000 cycles, with differential 5 ° C</p>
<p><b>Calibration temperatures:</b> Available on request (minimum of start of production 1000 pieces applicable for specific values).</p>
<p><b>Heating cable end sealing:</b> With a17x30x8mm PA66 over-molding.</p>
<p><b>Power supply connection :</b> With H05VVF cord with CEE 7/7, 2 poles + earth molded plug, or with cable (3x 1.5mm², 3x1mm², 3x0.75mm²). Cable type, plug type, cable gauge and length according to customer specification. Over-molding is possible without ground conductor (2 pole plug type CEE 7/16 or 7/17 )</p>
          <p><b>Connecting heating cable side:</b> This device is over-molded on heating cable supplied by the customer only. The molding tools are then adapted to the dimensions of cables. Minimum order 1000 pcs per cable section (mixed lengths accepted).</p>
          <p><b>Product identification:</b> Reference label on the cord and coded date on the thermostat molding</p>
           <p><b>Fixation:</b> It is possible to fix the thermostat body on a tube with plastic tie</p>
           <p><b>Important note :</b> self-regulating heating cables used in heat tracing develop a significant over current peak in cold conditions (Value depends on the manufacturer). This must be taken into account for the selection of the thermostat breaking capacity.</p>
