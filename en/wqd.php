              <h5>Applications</h5>
              <p>This thermostat is an automatic control of wood, pellets, coal or anthracite fired solid fuel appliances like room heaters, boilers, stoves, central heating units.<br>
              Its modulating action provides economy in fuel consumption.</p>
              <h5>Main features</h5>
                <p><b>Operation principle:</b> : It controls the combustion by throttling the primary air intake to the fire. A flat damper plate at the end of the control arm is moved relative to the air intake port of the appliance in response to variations of temperature at the bulb.<br>
                It is actuated by the expansion of liquid in the bulb, through capillary tubing to a diaphragm located in the body.</p>
                <p><b>Body:</b> Zinc plated steel</p>
                <p><b>Shaft:</b> Dia. 6mm, with 4.8mm flat, with 270° angular rotation.</p>
                <p><b>Fixing:</b> By means of the backside bracket, for dia 4mm screws, distance 42 to 48mm (Front mounting by 2 screws M4, 28mm distance available on request)</p>
               <p><b>Temperature Ranges:</b><br>
              -Room Air Control 4/40°C (40/105°F). Damper displacement between 4 and 40°C (40/105°F), with a 170mm length arm: 12.5mm<br>
              -Hot water 30/90°C (85/195°F)). Damper displacement between 30 and 90°C (85/195°F), with a 170mm length arm: 9.5mm<br>
              -Flue temperature 50/300°C (120/570°F). Damper displacement between 50 and 300°C (120/570°F), with a 170mm length arm: 9.5mm<br>
